Once cut, you must be very careful moving the pieces to avoid natural fissures in the stone from separating and cracking.

This product takes years of experience to work with. Being invested in the proper equipment and tools play a key factor in your success with fabricating this product. We hold every certification and keep up with continuing education programs to make sure we are on the cutting edge of proper technique for fabricating and installing porcelain of any brand. Porcelain is known for its almost perfect resemblance to real stone and extreme durability. Porcelain slabs are exactly what you might think they are, a large durable tile. They are heat resistant and non-absorbent making them an ideal and maintenance-free material for any application. The reason porcelain has such an unmistakable accuracy to real stone over the current popular market synthetic stone “Quartz” is because porcelain is actually a high-resolution photo of the actual stone it is imitating.

This stone comes in many different forms and densities. Its uniqueness and impressive designs that naturally come from the earth are what make quartzite so sought after. Quartzites can range drastically in price. Quartzite can be very difficult to cut. The tools and feed rates must be sharp and slow to avoid miter blowouts and chatter, or even crashing or binding your blade and mill/core bits into the stone. Once cut, you must be very careful moving the pieces to avoid natural fissures in the stone from separating and cracking. There is usually no margin for error when working with quartzites because of their limited runs from the quarry. A lot of times you cannot get more matching stone from your specific run or block.
